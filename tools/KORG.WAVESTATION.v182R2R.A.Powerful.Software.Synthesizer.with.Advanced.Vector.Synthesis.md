KORG WAVESTATION v1.8.2-R2R is a software synthesizer that reproduces the sound of the legendary WAVESTATION hardware synthesizer, which appeared in 1990 with its new "advanced vector synthesis system". This system produced a new sound by combining and shifting between multiple complex waveforms, allowing the user to create dynamic and expressive sounds with a joystick or a wave sequence.

The software synthesizer provides all 484 waveforms and 55 effects found on the WAVESTATION series (including the WAVESTATION-SR!), with 32 digital oscillators, 32 digital filters, 64 envelope generators, and 64 LFOs that allow letter-perfect replication of the three-dimensional WAVESTATION sound[^1^]. It also features a redesigned graphical user interface that takes advantage of the intuitive operation possible with software.
 
In addition to all of the WAVESTATION's factory preset programs, 550 performances, and 385 patches, the software synthesizer also includes all of the PCM, Program, and Combination data found in the original M1 and the M1EX internal PCM expansion, plus the PCM data and Program/Combination data from all nineteen optional ROM cards[^1^]. That's a total of over 1,500 preset sounds and an enormous amount of added PCM waveforms and wave sequences for even more variegated sound production.

- Use the search button in the Performance list view to find sounds by name, category, or tag[^2^]. You can also use the randomize button to generate new sounds by combining different waveforms and parameters[^2^].
- Use the joystick or the mouse to control the vector synthesis in real time. You can change the balance and modulation of the four oscillators in each patch, creating dynamic and expressive sounds[^1^].
- Use the wave sequence editor to create your own wave sequences. You can select waves from the internal ROM bank or import your own samples in .SYX format[^1^]. You can also adjust the duration, crossfade, pitch, level, and pan of each step in the sequence[^1^].
- Use the effect processors to add more depth and character to your sounds. You can choose from 55 different effects, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, distortion, and more[^1^]. You can also chain two effects together for more complex results[^1^].

KORG WAVESTATION v1.8.2-R2R is a versatile and powerful software synthesizer that can create a wide range of sounds, from realistic to futuristic. By exploring its features and functions, you can discover new sonic possibilities and expand your musical horizons.
